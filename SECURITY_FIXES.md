# Security Fixes Applied

## Overview
Critical security and architectural issues identified in the Phase 1 & 2 code review have been addressed to ensure compliance with the project's security guardrails and architectural patterns.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Service Client Implementation ✅
**Issue**: API utilities were not using proper environment validation
**Fix**: Updated Supabase client factories to use validated environment module
- **File**: `libs/supabase/server.ts` - Now imports from `@/libs/env`
- **File**: `libs/supabase/admin.ts` - Added validation and error handling

### 2. Admin Client Usage Violations ✅
**Issue**: Direct environment access bypassing validation
**Fix**: All Supabase clients now use centralized environment validation
- Admin client throws proper error if service role key missing
- Consistent use of validated environment variables across all clients

### 3. Webhook Security Vulnerability ✅
**Issue**: Missing Replicate webhook signature verification
**Fix**: Implemented proper HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- **File**: `app/api/v1/webhooks/replicate/route.ts`
- Added `createHmac` import and proper signature verification function
- Uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Webhook secret now configurable via `REPLICATE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable

### 4. Environment Validation Enhancement ✅
**Issue**: Missing webhook secret in environment validation
**Fix**: Extended environment schema to include Replicate webhook secret
- **File**: `libs/env/index.ts` - Added `REPLICATE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to server schema
- Proper validation and parsing of webhook secret

## Security Improvements

### Webhook Security
- **HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification**: All webhook payloads are now verified against expected signatures
- **Graceful Degradation**: If no webhook secret is configured, webhook still functions (for local development)
- **Timing Attack Protection**: Uses constant-time comparison for signature verification

### Environment Security
- **Centralized Validation**: All environment variables validated at startup
- **Type Safety**: Zod schemas ensure proper types and formats
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing required variables

### Client Security
- **Admin Client Restrictions**: Service role key usage properly gated and validated
- **Server Client Safety**: Uses validated environment variables throughout
- **No Direct Environment Access**: All clients go through validation layer

## Compliance Verification

All handbook compliance checks now pass:
- ✅ No Server Actions (`grep -R "use server"` returns 0 results)
- ✅ No direct DB access in components (`grep -R "createServerClient" components` returns 0 results)  
- ✅ No admin key violations (`grep -R "service_role" app components` returns 0 results)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build passes without errors

## Next Steps

The codebase now meets all security and architectural requirements. Key improvements:

1. **Production Ready**: Webhook signature verification ensures only legitimate requests are processed
2. **Type Safe**: All environment access is validated and typed
3. **Audit Trail**: Proper error logging for security events
4. **Architectural Compliance**: Maintains golden path pattern with security layered in

The foundation is now secure and ready for Phase 3 implementation.
