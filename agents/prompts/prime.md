2. **Get project tree structure** - run the  tree -I 'node_modules|.next|.git|dist|build|out|.DS_Store|*.tsbuildinfo|next-env.d.ts|.env*.local|.vercel|*.log' to get the strucure of the codebase. So it helps you navigate the code base quickly. You don't have to give me or print the tree structure for me. It's just for your understanding. dont create any files.
