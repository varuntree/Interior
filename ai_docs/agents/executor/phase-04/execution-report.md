## Build Results

```bash
npm run build
```

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

Build completed successfully with all new endpoints listed:
- `/api/v1/collections`
- `/api/v1/collections/[id]`
- `/api/v1/collections/items/toggle`
- `/api/v1/collections/upsert`
- `/api/v1/favorites/list`

## Handbook Compliance Checks

### 1. Server Actions Check
```bash
grep -R "use server" app libs
```
**Result**: ✅ **0 matches** - No server actions detected

### 2. Server Client in Components Check
```bash
grep -R "createServerClient" components
```
**Result**: ✅ **0 matches** - No server client usage in components

### 3. Service Role Usage Check
```bash
grep -R "service_role" app components
```
**Result**: ✅ **0 matches** - No service role usage outside webhooks

All handbook rules are fully complied with.

## Implementation Verification

✅ **Golden Path Architecture**: API → Service → Repository → DB pattern followed consistently
✅ **Authentication**: All endpoints require user authentication via Supabase
✅ **Validation**: Zod schemas validate all POST request bodies
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error responses with status codes and messages
✅ **RLS Policies**: Database tables secured with owner-only access policies
✅ **Performance**: Indexes created for query optimization
✅ **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes

## Implementation Notes

- Fixed TypeScript validation checks to use `'res' in validation` pattern matching existing codebase
- Removed unused imports to pass linting
- All API endpoints follow established response patterns with proper headers
- Database migrations include proper constraints and performance indexes
- Services use context injection pattern consistent with existing code
- Repositories handle errors appropriately with descriptive messages

## No Constraints or Deferred Items

All items from the change specification were successfully implemented. No items were deferred back to planner.
