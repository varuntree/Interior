# EXECUTION REPORT — Phase 05 Billing and Credits Implementation

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the credits system for the Interior Design AI app with server-side credit enforcement and monthly generation limits.

### Files Created (3)
1. `/Users/varunprasad/Desktop/Interior/libs/constants/limits.ts` - Central plan limits configuration
2. `/Users/varunprasad/Desktop/Interior/libs/services/credits.ts` - Credits service with usage counting and enforcement
3. `/Users/varunprasad/Desktop/Interior/app/api/v1/credits/summary/route.ts` - API endpoint for credit summary

### Files Modified (2)
1. `/Users/varunprasad/Desktop/Interior/libs/repositories/generations.ts` - Added `countForUserSince` function 
2. `/Users/varunprasad/Desktop/Interior/libs/services/generations.ts` - Replaced stub credit checking with real implementation

### Lines Added: ~185 total
- limits.ts: 8 lines
- credits.ts: 127 lines  
- summary/route.ts: 27 lines
- generations.ts (repo): 18 lines
- generations.ts (service): 5 lines net (removed 7, added 12)

## Build Results

```
$ npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully
Linting and checking validity of types ...

Warnings only (no errors):
- Unused variables in generate/page.tsx and collections/route.ts  
- Image optimization suggestions
- Unused 'req' parameter in credits/summary/route.ts
```

**Result: ✅ BUILD PASSED** - No type errors, only warnings

## Grep Check Results

Required handbook security checks:

```bash
$ grep -R "use server" app libs
# Result: 0 matches ✅

$ grep -R "createServerClient" components  
# Result: 0 matches ✅

$ grep -R "service_role" app components
# Result: 0 matches ✅
```

**Result: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED** - No forbidden patterns found

## Implementation Notes

### Credits System Design
- **Plan limits**: Centralized in `libs/constants/limits.ts` (deliberately empty for Varun to populate)
- **Default free cap**: 10 generations per month for users without paid plans
- **Monthly period**: UTC calendar months for consistency
- **Usage counting**: Counts all generations regardless of status (processing/succeeded/failed)
- **Error handling**: Safe fallbacks to free tier limits on failures

### Credit Enforcement Flow
1. API route calls `creditsService.checkAndConsumeCredit()`
2. Service concurrently fetches user's plan cap and current usage
3. Compares usage against cap and returns result
4. Generation service throws 402 error if limit exceeded

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/v1/credits/summary` - Returns `{ remainingCredits, monthlyLimit, planId }`
- Requires authentication, returns 401 if unauthenticated
- Uses standard response format with cache-control headers

### Repository Method Added
- `countForUserSince(supabase, userId, sinceDate)` - Counts generations since specified date
- Uses Supabase RLS for user-scoped access
- Exact count with proper error handling

## Constraints & Deferred Work

### Plan Configuration
- `PLAN_LIMITS` object left empty as specified
- Varun needs to populate with actual Stripe price IDs and limits
- System defaults to 10 generations for unknown/null price_ids

### No Database Changes Required
- Used existing `generations` table for counting
- Leveraged existing `profiles.price_id` field for plan identification
- No migrations needed

### Future Enhancements Not Implemented
- Detailed billing history
- Proration logic
- Usage analytics/reporting
- Credit purchase flows

## Testing Notes

### Credit Summary Endpoint
- ✅ Responds to GET requests with authentication
- ✅ Returns expected JSON structure
- ✅ Handles unauthenticated requests with 401

### Generation Enforcement  
- ✅ Credit check integrated into generation submission flow
- ✅ Proper error messages and HTTP codes (402 for limit exceeded)
- ✅ Maintains existing generation functionality

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks when profile lookup fails
- ✅ Safe defaults when generation counting fails  
- ✅ Proper error propagation with structured messages

## Verification Complete

All requirements from the change specification have been implemented:
- ✅ Central plan limits configuration outside config.ts
- ✅ Credits service with plan resolution and usage counting
- ✅ Real credit enforcement in generation service  
- ✅ Repository method for monthly generation counting
- ✅ Optional credits summary API endpoint
- ✅ No new database tables created
- ✅ Golden path followed: API → Service → Repository → DB
- ✅ Server-side enforcement only, no client-side credit logic
