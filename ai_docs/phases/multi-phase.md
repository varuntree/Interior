# Multi-Phase Implementation Plan - Interior Design AI Generator

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation strategy for building the Interior Design AI Generator application from ground up. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a systematic, testable, and production-ready development process.

## Project Context
- **Product**: Interior Design AI Generator for Australian market
- **Stack**: Next.js 14, Supabase, Stripe, Replicate (OpenAI gpt-image-1), Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: API Routes → Services → Repositories → Database (No Server Actions)
- **Key Features**: 4 generation modes (Redesign, Staging, Compose, Imagine), Collections, Community galleries

## Implementation Principles
All phases must strictly adhere to:
- **Handbook** (`ai_docs/docs/01-handbook.md`): Golden path architecture rules
- **Playbooks** (`ai_docs/docs/02-playbooks-and-templates.md`): Implementation templates
- **Specifications** (`ai_docs/spec/*`): Product requirements and technical contracts

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration
**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure, configuration, and database schema
- Runtime configuration system
- Database migrations (generation_jobs, renders, collections, etc.)
- API utilities and response standardization
- Basic repository layer setup
- Environment configuration

### Phase 2: Generation Engine Core
**Goal**: Implement the complete generation pipeline
- Generation service with Replicate integration
- API routes for generation submission
- Webhook processing for async results
- Storage integration for inputs/outputs
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Data Management Layer
**Goal**: Complete repository and service implementations
- All repository functions (generation_jobs, renders, collections, etc.)
- Usage tracking and quota enforcement
- Collections management (including "My Favorites")
- Community collections structure

### Phase 4: API Surface
**Goal**: Complete all API endpoints with proper validation
- Auth endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/me`)
- Generation endpoints (submit, get status)
- Renders CRUD operations
- Collections management endpoints
- Usage and billing endpoints
- Community endpoints

### Phase 5: Dashboard UI Foundation
**Goal**: Build the core dashboard infrastructure
- Dashboard layouts with auth guards
- Sidebar navigation
- Theme integration (design tokens)
- Responsive mobile-first layouts
- Base components setup

### Phase 6: Generation UI & Workflows
**Goal**: Implement the complete generation experience
- Create/generation workspace (all 4 modes)
- File upload handling
- Real-time status updates
- Results display and actions
- My Renders gallery
- Collections UI

### Phase 7: Polish & Production Readiness
**Goal**: Complete remaining features and production preparation
- Community galleries
- Settings and billing integration
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Performance optimizations
- Testing and quality checks
- Production deployment checklist

## Success Criteria
Each phase is considered complete when:
1. All specified features are fully implemented
2. Code follows handbook rules (no Server Actions, proper architecture)
3. API responses use normalized format
4. Database operations use repository pattern
5. UI is responsive and follows design system
6. Manual smoke tests pass
7. TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Development Workflow
1. Load relevant spec documents before starting each phase
2. Follow templates from playbooks for consistent implementation
3. Test each component in isolation before integration
4. Verify against handbook rules after implementation
5. Run quality checks before moving to next phase

## Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Testing**: Each phase produces testable features
- **Architecture Compliance**: Strict adherence to golden path prevents refactoring
- **Clear Contracts**: API and data contracts defined upfront
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design from the start
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features first, polish later

## Notes for AI Agents
- Always reference spec documents for requirements
- Use exact templates from playbooks
- Never use Server Actions or direct DB calls from components
- Follow the exact file structure and naming conventions
- Implement mobile-responsive UI from the beginning
- Test each phase independently before proceeding

## Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Generation Engine)
    ↓
Phase 3 (Data Layer)
    ↓
Phase 4 (API Surface)
    ↓
Phase 5 (Dashboard Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 6 (Generation UI)
    ↓
Phase 7 (Polish & Production)
```

Each phase must be completed successfully before starting the next phase.
