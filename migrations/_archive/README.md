Archived legacy migrations
==========================

This folder contains all prior migration files as they existed before the reset
to a single baseline. They are preserved for reference only.

Going forward, new environments should start from `migrations/0001_baseline.sql`,
and future changes should be added as forward-only migrations on top of that.

Do not apply files in this `_archive` folder.
